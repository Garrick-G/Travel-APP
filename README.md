#Travel APP Capstone

App built from scratch to receive a city name and dates, outputting a card containing weather
information, a countdown, and an image for the city. The APIs included are

-Pixabay : for images of the locations

-Weatherbit : for weather information

-Geonames : for location information, longitude, latitude, etc.

###Chosen Paths

For this project, I chose some extra things from the list to take on.
Of the list, I chose:

-adding an end date

-allow the user to remove trips

-allow additional trips

And although it wasn't on the list, I chose to integrate Webpack 5 instead of 4
like the other projects. I felt it would allow me to understand everything more,
challenging myself by needing to read documentation, troubleshoot bugs, and research
everything.
